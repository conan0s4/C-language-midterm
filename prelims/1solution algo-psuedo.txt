Non-Divisible Subset
take the set numbers then mod each by k store how many times each remainder appears then start counting
if remainder 0 exists only one can stay in subset
then go loop from 1 until k divide by 2 take the higher count between remainder i and remainder k minus i
if k even then only one can stay from remainder k divide by 2
add them all up that’s the answer

Queen's Attack II
queen can move in eight directions
store all obstacles in a quick lookup like set
for each direction move one step at a time
if next square still inside board and not blocked keep counting
if hit obstacle or outside stop that direction
after checking all directions total squares counted is answer

Bigger is Greater
find from end the first letter that breaks descending order
then find from end the smallest letter bigger than that letter
swap them
reverse everything after that position
if no break found then say no answer

Absolute Permutation
if k equal 0 then just output numbers 1 to n
if n mod (2 times k) not equal 0 then no possible so output -1
else start from 1 to n
make a flip flag false
every block of size k switch between adding k and subtracting k
if flip false then add k to i
else subtract k from i
every k count toggle flip
collect in list then return it

Lily's Homework
make a copy of arr called asc sort it ascending
make a copy of arr called desc sort it descending
now define a helper that counts swaps needed to turn arr into target
inside helper
make a map each value to its index
count = 0
loop i from 0 to arr length minus 1
if arr[i] not equal target[i]
then count plus one
find index of target[i] using map
swap arr[i] and arr[index]
update map for swapped values
after loop return count
finally call helper once with asc once with desc
return the smaller result


Highest Value Palindrome
start from both ends left and right
count mismatched pairs
store which ones not equal
if mismatches > k then impossible return -1
first pass fix the mismatched ones smallest to biggest
each mismatch change lower digit to higher one
use one change per mismatch mark position as changed
second pass go again from both ends
if still have extra changes left
for each pair if both digits less than 9
then if either one changed before then only need 1 more
else need 2
if can afford that change both to 9
middle digit if odd length and still have one change make it 9
return new string

Common Child
make a table dp with size of both strings plus one rows and columns
loop i from 1 to length of first string
loop j from 1 to length of second string
if the letter at s1[i minus 1] same as s2[j minus 1] then dp[i][j] equals dp[i minus 1][j minus 1] plus 1
else dp[i][j] equals max of dp[i minus 1][j] and dp[i][j minus 1]
after both loops the last cell dp[length of s1][length of s2] is the answer

Red John is Back
take n as input
create an array ways of size n+1
ways of 0 1 2 3 set to 1 1 1 1
for i from 4 to n
ways of i = ways of i-1 + ways of i-4
this gives total arrangements of bricks
next find number of primes up to ways of n
create a bool array isprime of size ways of n +1 all true
set isprime of 0 and 1 false
for i from 2 to sqrt(ways of n)
if isprime of i true
for j = i*i to ways of n step i
set isprime of j false

The Power Sum
start with X N given
make a function helper that takes total power num
convert num to the power
if val equals total return 1 means found one combo
if val bigger stop return 0
otherwise keep checking two sides
one include that number minus its power
one skip that number and move to next
add both counts get total ways
start helper from num 1 until done

get the biggest hurdle
compare it with k
if k enough say zero
if not enough say the difference

start take string s check each split half take start if start 
has 0 skip then loop add next number as string until length 
reach same compare if equal say yes and print first 
number else say no



Making Anagrams
the idea here is i just count how many times each letter appears 
in both strings then for every letter i subtract the counts and 
take the absolute value to see how many need to be deleted to 
balance them and finally i add up all those differences to 
get the total deletions needed to make them perfect anagrams


Sherlock and Cost
so the idea here is just thinking every element can either be 
the lowest possible one or the highest value from b then track
two possibilities low means we pick one and high means we pick 
the given number each step we update them based on which gives 
higher difference we take absolute difference between consecutive 
pairs and keep adding that up we compare both paths each time so 
by the end whichever is larger gives the total max cost


Short Palindrome
the idea here is basically like this i go through each character 
one by one keeping track how many ways i can build patterns that 
lead up to that 4 letter palindrome so first counts single letters 
then second counts pairs then third counts triplets that can form
with matching first and last letter and finally when i reach 
another matching letter i add that to the total count as a 
valid 4-length palindrome all done under 
modulo so it won’t overflow

Minimum Loss
lauren has to buy the house one year and sell it another year but with a 
loss so to minimize that loss i first keep track of each price and its 
original year index then i sort all prices ascending so i can compare 
only close values next i loop from the second smallest to the largest 
and for each pair i check if the higher price happened before the lower 
one in the original order if so that means it’s a valid loss scenario 
then i calculate the loss difference between the two and keep track 
of the smallest one that satisfies that rule in the end i return 
that smallest difference as the minimum possible loss


Candies
the logic goes like this each child starts with one candy then check
from left to right if the next child has higher rating it gets one 
more candy than the previous one after that go from right to left 
if the previous child has higher rating than the next one make 
sure it gets at least one more than the next one this way both 
sides’ conditions are satisfied then sum up all candies for 
the minimum total

The Grid Search
the logic goes like this it loops through every possible top left start 
in the grid then checks if the first pattern row matches a substring in 
that part if it does it continues checking the following pattern rows
below it if all rows match perfectly it returns yes otherwise if it 
finishes scanning everything without a match it returns no



Correctness and the Loop Invariant
the algorithm works by taking one element at a time from the unsorted 
portion of the array and placing it into the correct position in the 
sorted portion it starts at the second element and compares it 
backward until it finds the right spot it shifts elements that 
are greater than the current one and finally places it correctly 
the fixed condition j>=0 ensures that the loop checks even the
first index preventing skipping the smallest value after the
final iteration the entire array is sorted and printed once


New Year Chaos
the logic goes like this I just count how many times a person was overtaken by 
someone who originally was behind them I loop from the end of the list and check 
if any person has moved more than two spots ahead if yes then it’s too chaotic 
if not I check from two positions before their original place up to their 
current position and count how many have higher numbers meaning they 
bribed their way forward I add all those up to get the total number 
of bribes and print it
