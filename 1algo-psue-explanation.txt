algo/pseudo:
hackerrank site (coding challenge)


SOLVE ME FIRST
the function (solvemefirst) has a parameter of 2 integers a & b
this method was used in the main class 
its non static so we call the method directly
from the main method we ask for the users input for integer value 1 & 2
we then use solvemefirst function to add the two values and so the method returns the results
which was done in that function


A VERY BIG SUM
in the main method we asked user to input array or set of numbers
then we use the averybigsum function to get the sum of the set of numbers that 
was given in our main method...ittirating through the array adding current number to the current setted sum 
until we get the total sum of the array..returning that result to our main method and lastly outputting it 



BIRTHDAY CAKE CANDLES
in the challenge it was said that only the tallest candles will be blown 
the age & candles where set already in the main class
in our birthdaycakecandles method or function we got the candles from the main and will be
using those elements here in our birthdaycakecandles function..first off we try and find the tallest candle with the help of .max()
& next is we gonna be counting the number of elements in the the array  using .count() but we 
will be adding some conditions where it counts the tallest candles...
if the candle is equals to the max or the tallest candle then that includes it to the count
after that we return the results to our main which gives us the number of candles 
that will be blown
